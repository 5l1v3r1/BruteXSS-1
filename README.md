# BruteXSS

BruteXSS is a tool written in python simply to find XSS vulnerabilities in web application.

This tool was originally developed by Shawar Khan in CLI. I just redesigned it and made it GUI for more convienience.

This tool is developed in Python, so obviously cross platform, you just need Python installed in your machine.
